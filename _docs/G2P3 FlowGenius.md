# **FlowGenius**

### **Introduction**

Desktop applications represent a unique opportunity in the AI era. Unlike web or mobile apps constrained by browsers or platform limitations, desktop applications can deeply integrate with your operating system, run persistent background processes, and execute complex AI workflows locally. This creates possibilities for sophisticated automation and intelligence that simply aren't feasible in other environments.

Think about the productivity tools you use daily. There's probably one that gets 80% of the way to what you need, but falls short in crucial ways. Maybe your task manager lacks intelligent prioritization, your note-taking app can't connect ideas automatically, or your file organizer doesn't understand your workflow patterns. This is your chance to build the productivity tool you've always wanted but no one has built yet.

### **Project Overview**

After mastering web and mobile application development using AI-first methodologies, you'll now tackle desktop application development. This 4-day intensive project challenges you to create the productivity solution that's been missing from your toolkit \- leveraging the unique capabilities of desktop environments and intelligent workflow automation.

### **Duration & Scope**

**Monday \- Thursday (4 Days)**

* **Early Submission Deadline**: Tuesday at 8 PM Central \- Core functionality working  
* **Final Submission Deadline**: Thursday at 8 PM Central \- Polished final version  
* Friday is a day off for 4th of July, followed by preparation for the Austin in-person section  
* Full creative control over your development approach  
* Leverage AI coding tools and methodologies you've learned  
* Focus on desktop-specific capabilities and user experiences

### **Project Goals**

Build the productivity tool you've always wanted but no one has built yet:

* **Solve your own productivity problem** \- Focus on something that genuinely frustrates you or slows you down  
* **Improve existing solutions** \- Take a tool you use but wish worked better and build your ideal version  
* **Leverage intelligent automation** \- Use LangGraph and/or n8n to create workflows that run seamlessly in the background  
* **Harness desktop advantages** \- Utilize local processing, system integration, and persistent background operations  
* **Create something you'll actually use** \- Build a tool that becomes part of your daily workflow

### **Project Focus**

This isn't about building for a generic user base \- it's about solving **your** problem. Consider:

**The "Almost Perfect" Tool**: What productivity app do you use that gets close but misses the mark? What would make it perfect for your workflow?

**The Missing Tool**: What task do you do manually that could be automated with intelligent workflows? What productivity solution have you always wished existed?

**Examples of Personal Productivity Problems**:

* Research workflows that could auto-organize and cross-reference information  
* File management that understands your coding project patterns  
* Writing tools that integrate with your knowledge base and research process  
* Development workflow automation that handles repetitive coding tasks  
* Personal dashboard that aggregates and intelligently filters information from multiple sources

### **Technical Requirements**

* **Platform**: Desktop application for one operating system of your choice (Windows, macOS, or Linux)  
* **Required Framework**: Must use **LangGraph** and/or **N8N** for intelligent workflow automation  
* **Local Workflow Execution**: Build and run AI workflows locally within your application  
* **Background Intelligence**: Implement workflows that can run in the background to enhance user experience  
* **Personal Problem Focus**: Must solve a productivity problem you personally face

### **Workflow Integration Options**

Your LangGraph/N8N integration could serve various purposes:

**Application Lifecycle Automation**:

* Automatically organize files when the app starts  
* Background processing of data while you work  
* Intelligent notifications and reminders

**Feature Enhancement Workflows**:

* Auto-completion and suggestions powered by AI  
* Smart categorization and tagging  
* Content generation or formatting assistance

**Background Intelligence**:

* Continuous monitoring and optimization of your workflow  
* Predictive actions based on usage patterns  
* Automated synchronization and backup processes

**User Experience Flows**:

* Seamless data processing between different parts of your app  
* Intelligent error handling and recovery  
* Adaptive interface changes based on user behavior

### **Success Criteria**

Your project will be evaluated on:

* **Problem Definition**: How clearly you identify and articulate the problem you're solving  
* **Solution Effectiveness**: How well your application addresses the identified problem  
* **Technical Implementation**: Quality of code, use of AI tools, and desktop integration  
* **User Experience**: Intuitive design and smooth functionality  
* **Innovation**: Creative use of AI capabilities and desktop-specific features

### **Getting Started Framework**

#### **Day 1: Discovery & Planning (LangGraph Class)**

* Attend LangGraph class to understand AI workflow orchestration  
* Identify your target problem (personal or user-focused)  
* Research existing solutions and identify gaps  
* Define core features and intelligent workflow requirements  
* Set up development environment and project structure

#### **Day 2: Development Sprint (N8N Class \+ Early Submission Target)**

* Attend N8N class to learn automation framework capabilities  
* Begin building core functionality using AI-first development practices  
* Implement basic AI workflow integration (LangGraph, n8n, or similar)  
* Focus on getting primary features working  
* **Early Submission Due: Tuesday 8 PM Central** \- Core functionality should be operational

#### **Day 3-4: Polish & Enhancement**

* Integrate additional AI capabilities (APIs, automation, intelligent features)  
* Refine user experience and desktop-specific features  
* Fix bugs and improve overall polish  
* **Final Submission Due: Thursday 8 PM Central** \- Complete, polished application

### **Recommended Technologies**

**Prioritize web-based languages for familiar development experience:**

* **Desktop Frameworks**:

  * **Electron** (recommended) \- Build with HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript

  * **Tauri** (emerging framework) \- Rust backend with web frontend, smaller bundle size

  * Focus on frameworks that leverage your existing web development skills

* **AI Workflow Frameworks**:

  * **LangGraph** \- Build complex AI agent workflows with state management

  * **N8N** \- Visual workflow automation with extensive integrations

    * *Review and understand basic webhook structure before building your automation*

  * **Required**: Must use at least one of these frameworks in your application

  * Local workflow execution capabilities within your desktop app

* **Backend/Database**:

  * **Firebase** \- Real-time database, authentication, cloud functions

  * **Supabase** \- Open-source alternative to Firebase with PostgreSQL

* **AI Integration**: Claude API, OpenAI API, local AI models integrated with workflow frameworks

### **Submission Guidelines**

At the end of the week, you'll need to submit the following:

1. **GitHub Repository:** A link to your project's public GitHub repository with complete source code and documentation

2. **Video Demo:** A 5-minute walkthrough showcasing your automations and core functionality

3. **Deployed Application:** A link to the working deployed application where users can test all features

4. **BrainLift**: A link to the document you used to learn, understand, and enhance the application with AI workflows

5. **Social Media Post:** A link to a post on X (Twitter) or LinkedIn showcasing your process of building with AI workflows, key technical achievements, or insights gained during development

### **Final Notes**

This project is about building something you genuinely want to use. The best outcome isn't just a working application, but a tool that becomes part of your daily workflow. Focus on solving a real problem you face rather than building something technically impressive but practically useless.

Desktop applications with AI workflow integration represent the cutting edge of productivity tools. You have the opportunity to create something that leverages local processing power, persistent background operations, and intelligent automation in ways that web and mobile apps simply can't match.

**Remember**: You're not building for a theoretical user \- you're building for yourself. What productivity tool have you always wanted but never found? Build that.
