# 1. Organizing a folder of messy files

The mvp would focus on `.pdf` files eg., as produced by a document scanner or downloaded via email. These often have uninformative names (like `scan0001.pdf`) but contain information within themselves sufficient to give them informative names and put them into a more organized folder system. _In my life, I have important documents of my own, documents belonging to my wife, documents belonging to my parents or in-laws, etc. that I scan and track. It would be great to automatically give new scans informative file names and mention who they pertain to with in-name tags like `[owner]`._ The ideal solution runs in the background, always, and does this automatically with menu tray controls and notifications. It might be acceptable to have a cli or Electron GUI, though. GUI would provide a nice way to track the progress and change the settings that isn't just a terminal.

A solution to this problem could naturally extend itself to more agents that understand other file types and can organize them as well (eg., messy screenshots folder with names like `Screenshot 2025-07-01 at 01.43.55.png`).

It could even be extended do some of the work of the proposed Obsidian plugin, since Obsidian notes are just plain `.md` files in folders.

If launched as an actual product to other users, it would be natural to add comprehensive features for particular file types with new context-specific agents over time.

# 2. Novel writing assistant inside Obsidian

_I participate in a writing group with some other newbie/aspiring writers. In project 1, I started building a writing tool with the kinds of features I would want (or others in my group suggested)._ It would be much nicer to hook those features into Obsidian, which already has a performant, local-first multi-platform editor, than it would be to continue build a whole editor and its AI features from scratch (or from the project 1 web app).

Proposed AI features:
- genre conventions guidance
- automatic ABCDE feedback
	- Awesome, Boring, Confusing, Didn't Believe, Excited
- automatic plot analysis (view adherence to or divergence from conventions, identify holes)
- automatic cover and blurb generation
- track character arcs/bios
- analyze dialogue and suggest how to make each character's voice consistent and unique
- chat with characters to ask them what they'd do in certain situations
- pacing analysis
- exposition vs. dialogue breakdown
- visualize scenes, chapters, characters, etc.
- fantasy features:
	- map generation
	- language generator
- recommend similar works or factual readings for background research relevant to your concepts

## Why not pursue this one?

I sort of already started building it in project 1, and it'd be good to have variety. I think I also want enough (robust) features, eventually, that this is better built on a longer timeline.

# 3. Bookmarks/web links organizer

_Often I save web links to various things across three areas: my browser, [Anybox](https://anybox.app/), and Obsidian. This pile of potential insights, action items, etc. quickly grows unwieldy and doesn't end up being super useful._

It would be possible to leverage AI agents to automate a smarter solution to this problem. The problem, however, **starts at the browser** on any of my devices, so the first task is to have an **extension for every platform I use** that captures the bookmark in the first place.

Anybox and Obsidian already provide such extensions for capture. [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper) produces plain markdown files in an Obsidian vault and [supports iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/obsidian-web-clipper/id6720708363?platform=iphone), so it would be easiest to process, suggesting a smart web links organizer would take the form of an Obsidian plugin. I would also need to change my behavior to using Obsidian to save all of my links, which seems like a good idea for longevity and organization.

## Existing solutions

- [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper) itself
	- claimed features
		- Clip anything: From news articles and blog posts to recipes, product pages, and research papers ‚Äî if it's on the web, you can save it.
		- Select page content: Clip entire pages, selected text, or let the clipper intelligently extract just the main content.
		- Customizable templates: Create tailored templates to automatically extract metadata from web pages. Perfect for academics, movie buffs, book lovers, or anyone who wants structured notes.
		- Smart triggers: Set up rules to automatically apply the right template based on the website you're clipping from.
		- Seamless integration: all your clips flow directly into Obsidian, in the vault and folder of your choice.
	- limitations
		- not ai, requires manual configuration of rules and templates
- [Anybox](https://anybox.app/)
	- claimed features
		- save, capture, and tag links from anywhere
		- integration with mobile apps where links are sometimes hard to extract
	- limitations
		- not ai, requires manual organization

## Why not pursue this one?

By combining Obsidian Web Clipper with other plugins like Note Companion or AI Tagger Universe mentioned below, I could likely build a better workflow using existing tools.

# 4. Tagging, organizing, summarizing, or extracting entities from notes

As I use Obsidian to take notes, a solution would naturally take the form of an Obsidian plugin. That would provide some UI and settings/configuration options within Obsidian, as well as support local or remote LLMs for backend processes. _In my life, I find my Obsidian notes tend toward disorder over time. It would be useful to automatically organize them eg., by moving them into more appropriate folders and/or maintaining an informative set of tags and yaml frontmatter (metadata)._

Another useful feature would be automatic named entity extraction‚Äîeg., if I type a person's name in my notes, the plugin would provide a convenient way to see all mentions and information about that person without my having to explicitly make a `[[Person]]` note.

## Why not pursue this one?

Note Companion and AI Tagger Universe already look like a good existing solutions to this problem and can be used together. I am not sure what I would want to add without extensive use that will not occur in the next three days.

# 5. Shopping assistant

_I often spend time research "what's the best X" and comparing candidates across some dimensions before buying it. It is possible a better tool could be built to assist with this._

Features would include:
- look for reviews
- organize the candidates for "best of x"
- summarize pros and cons in a neat table sortable by priority trade-off

## Existing solutions

- Perplexity, and basically every leading AI tool

## Why not pursue this one?

I am doubtful I can build something better than Perplexity already is at this task in the given time and resource constraints.
